##  Our motivation: The lost of trust :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

I've always had a strong bond with animals and an insatiable desire to assist those in need. This profession has caused me to greatly admire the work of non-profit organisations that devote their lives to rescuing, caring for, and providing a dignified future for these animals.

I've worked with local organisations and felt tempted to donate to people who are doing outstanding work thousands of miles away. However, a persistent doubt haunts me: **how can I ensure that my assistance reaches its intended destination?**

Unfortunately, scams by unscrupulous individuals who exploit people's kindness have tainted trust in donations. They establish fictitious non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to raise funds that never contribute to the rescue of any animal.

Given this fact, we ask ourselves a fundamental question: Is there a method to ensure that every penny raised goes solely towards animal rescue?


## Our proposal: A chain of trust :handshake_tone4:

That question gave rise to **RESCATHENA** (a combination of '**Rescate' and 'Cadena', 'rescue' and 'chainâ€™** in Spanish). RESCATHENA is an initiative that uses blockchain technology as a foundation to foster an ecosystem of mutual trust among all its members.

**RESCATHENA** is a private, non-tokenized blockchain platform built solely to create a distributed, immutable, and transparent record of any activity that takes place there. It is a method that democratises and validates each stage of the assistance process.


## The Pillars of trust :material-pillar:

Our platform is built on community validation and extreme openness.

- **Donor Validation:** Any new donor member will be validated by the rest of the community to ensure the network's integrity.
- **NGO Validation:** Only organisations whose missions and authenticity have been validated and recognised by their current members will be able to use the system and accept donations.
- **Immutable donation record:** Every donation, regardless of size, will be permanently and irreversibly recorded on the blockchain and viewable to all members.
- **Radical transparency:** i**mpact proof.** This is our primary distinction. Every time an NGO uses funds received, it must justify each spending with verifiable proof (invoices, receipts, etc.) within the timeframe set by the community.
    - The "expense justification" is submitted for validation by all RESCATHENA members.
    - Following successful validation, the NGO will obtain **trust points** (on a scale of 1 to 10).
    - Organisations that do not maintain a minimal trust threshold (for example, a score below 5) will be immediately removed from the system, leaving only the most transparent and effective.


## Open project: Join the chain :fontawesome-solid-people-group:

**RESCATHENA** began as a personal effort, but its ultimate goal is to serve as a tool for everyone. It is a **completely open-source** initiative aimed solely at strengthening and helping non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that sincerely dedicate their efforts to the rescue of defenceless animals.

We welcome anyone to participate.Your talent is appreciated, whether you are:

- Expert in technology and development.
- Specialising in digital marketing or communication.
- Project manager.
- Graphic or UX designer.
- Hyperledger Solution Architect
- Understands the administration and needs of non-governmental organisations.


## Our Technology: The Foundation of Trust :simple-blockchaindotcom:

We chose **Hyperledger Fabric** as the blockchain technology for this project for the following reasons:

- **Open Source:** It is an open-source project managed by the respected Linux Foundation.
- **Privacy and permission:** Hyperledger Fabric, unlike public blockchains such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, is a private, permissioned network.You can only join via invitation, which ensures a secure and controlled environment.
- **Avoid speculation:** our purpose is to promote transparency, not to create a speculative digital asset.

We urge you to learn more about this technology at the official [Hyperledger page](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric)


> Together, we can create an unbreakable chain of trust in animal rescue.
