## Rescathena Network

Inspired by the [Sample Network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/network/network.html#the-sample-network) explained in the official documentation of hyperledger fabric documentation, this is a simplified version of the initial state of the Rescathena Network, which will evolve over time as new features and functionalities are added.

## Transaction Flow in Rescathena


Following the same guidelines as the Hyperledger's Transaction flow where the explain the process of a transaction in a blockchain network, we can outline how Rescathena operates in a similar manner. The Rescathena scenario involves Animal Rescue Organizations (AROs) that publish their initiatives, donors who fund these initiatives with donations through the Rescathena Network and the AROs that execute the initiatives and report back to the donors through the Rescathena Network.
